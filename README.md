# SnakeGame
I made a Snake game in Java - I watched a lot of tutorials on youtube and learned from those to be able to code my own snake game.  

The final snake game has a black background and a pink snake. I also put in a restart button and a way to make it faster and slower. 

There are 4 classes:
- The main class contains the main method that creates the JFrame and adds the board of the game to it
- The board class that hands all the game play
- The snake class contains the positions and shapes for the snake
- The apples class contains the positions and shapes for the apples

The Jar file is called SNAKE!
